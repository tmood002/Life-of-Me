        <div class="subheading mb-5">Education MajorðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My education journey has been long and continuous as I have grown and developed over the years of high school and college. My career goal is to become a math teacher, somewhere between 5th grade and 7th grade students. Iâ€™ve chosen math as my subject because itâ€™s one of the fundamentals in this world, also because it is very important to know and learn. The grade levels are important to me because thatâ€™s the years I remember most and gained the most educational and social knowledge. The teachers in my classes made me aspire to be like them, helping kids to be their best selves and to learn all they can. So, learning how to be a teacher like them became my goal and growing up to one day hopefully change someone else's life. In between these two different education levels, I have struggled much with finding the correct path to my educational future. It is sometimes hard knowing what I want in college, but it was even harder knowing what I wanted to do in high school. <br><br>

         My first struggle began in high school, back when I thought I knew what I wanted but actually didnâ€™t have a clue. I was in a class that helps you in getting into college by helping you be organized, being more punctual, creating and managing your time, and even helping with visits to colleges. One of my favorite teachers actually took this class, a teacher who I also aspire to be like, respected but also approachable. The class, and my teacher, helped me to decide that college wasnâ€™t just some far off place with more homework and a meaner teachers, but an opportunity to make my dream of being a teacher come true. They even helped me to realize that college was also going to be harder than high school was, which at the time I thought high school was easy. But I was determined to become a teacher and knew that college would help me to become one.<br><br>

        Having them there as support and helping me build my character, I knew getting into college was a goal that was not far off. However, when applying for college, I was, at the moment, having a different thought of being an actor, putting my teaching dreams to the side. So I applied to universities under theater major, hoping to have my temporary dreams of being an actor come to fruition. Fast forward from freshman year at Ucr to my now third year, Iâ€™m realizing I want to get back to my roots of teachings. So, I applied for a major switch and have talked to counselors and will be transferred, depending on my quarter grades.
